## Embedded Systems Development Workflow

To work effectively with embedded systems, it's essential to understand and use key development tools. The typical workflow involves the following **four steps**:

1. **Writing the Program** – Using text editors (e.g., VI or VIM)
2. **Compiling the Code** – Using a compiler (e.g., GCC)
3. **Debugging the Program** – Using a debugger (e.g., GDB)
4. **Loading the Program** – Using a linker/loader (e.g., LDD)

## 1. Text Editors

A **text editor** is a software application used to create and modify plain text files. These are essential tools for writing code, configuration files, and scripts in embedded system development.

### Types of Text Editors

There are two main types of text editors:

- **GUI (Graphical User Interface) Editors**
- **CLI (Command Line Interface) Editors**

#### i. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Editors

GUI editors provide a visual and interactive environment. Users can use menus, buttons, and graphical tools to edit files. These editors are beginner-friendly and offer productivity features like syntax highlighting, file explorers, and extensions.

**Examples:**  
- Notepad (Windows)  
- TextEdit (macOS)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Sublime Text  
- Atom

#### ii. Command Line Interface (CLI) Editors

CLI editors are accessed via a terminal. These are fast, lightweight, and ideal for low-resource environments or headless systems like embedded Linux.

**Examples:**  
- `vi` / `vim`  
- `nano`  
- `emacs` (also supports GUI)

CLI editors are widely used by advanced users and system administrators due to their efficiency and speed.

### Comparison: CLI vs GUI Editors

| Feature           | Command Line Interface (CLI)              | Graphical User Interface (GUI)              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Interaction**   | Keyboard command-based                    | Visual, icon and mouse-based                |
| **Ease of Use**   | Requires memorizing commands              | Easier to understand with visual elements  |
| **Memory Usage**  | Low memory footprint                      | Higher memory due to graphics               |
| **Speed**         | Fast, efficient with keyboard shortcuts   | Slower due to mouse-based interaction       |
| **Resources Used**| Only keyboard                            | Mouse and keyboard                          |
| **Accuracy**      | High                                      | Moderate                                    |
| **Flexibility**   | Consistent over time                      | May change with UI updates                  |

---

## 2. Compiler

A **compiler** is a tool that translates source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C) into low-level machine code or assembly that the microcontroller or processor can execute.

- In embedded systems, the most commonly used compiler is the **GNU C Compiler (GCC)**.
- It performs syntax checks and generates object code from your source files.

**Role in Embedded Systems:**  
Translates your `.c` files into `.o` or `.hex` files suitable for embedded hardware.

---

## 3. Debugger

A **debugger** is a critical tool used to test and troubleshoot your embedded code during runtime.

### Types of Errors:

- **Compile-Time Errors**: Detected by the compiler (e.g., syntax errors).
- **Run-Time Errors**: Occur during execution (e.g., segmentation faults, logic errors). These are resolved using a debugger.

**Common Tool:**  
- **GDB (GNU Debugger)** – allows line-by-line execution, variable inspection, breakpoints, and watchpoints.

**Why It’s Important:**  
Even experienced developers introduce bugs. A debugger helps isolate and fix issues in complex embedded environments.

---

## 4. Linker / Loader

### Linker

- The **linker** combines multiple object files into a single executable file.
- It resolves symbol references and assigns final memory addresses.

### Loader

- The **loader** loads the executable binary into the embedded system's memory (e.g., Flash or RAM).
- Some platforms use tools like **LDD** or device-specific bootloaders to load and start execution.

# VI - Text Editor

1. **VI** stands for **Visual Interface**. The advanced version of the Vi text editor is **Vim - Vi Improved**.
2. In Linux, we generally use CLI-based tools, such as the **Vi text editor**.
3. When you open the Ubuntu OS, there is a special application called the **Terminal Application**.
4. To write any C program, use the command:  
   ```bash
   $ vi filename.c
   ```
5. To open an existing C program:  
   ```bash
   $ vi filename.c
   ```
6. To list files present in the directory:  
   ```bash
   $ ls
   ```
7. **What are the different types of files that can be seen on the terminal when you run `$ls`?**  
   There are three types of files:
   - **White-colored files**: Normal/Text files.
   - **Blue-colored files**: Directories/Folders.
   - **Green-colored files**: Executable files.

8. **How can you view file information?**  
   By using additional flags with the `ls` command, such as:  
   ```bash
   $ ls -l
   ```
   This displays:
   - File permissions (Read/Write/Execute)
   - User name / Group
   - Size of the file
   - Date and time of last modification
   - File name

9. **Where can you find the flags and options used with the `$ls` command?**  
   - Use the manual pages:  
     ```bash
     $ man ls
     ```
   - Use the help option:  
     ```bash
     $ ls --help
     ```

10. **How to compile a C program in Ubuntu?**  
    Use the command:  
    ```bash
    $ gcc filename.c
    ```
    - This compiles the C statements into instructions.
    - Instructions contain **opcodes (operation codes)** and **operands**:
      - **Opcode**: Unique code specifying the operation.
      - **Operand**: Address in memory (can be a value or CPU register name).

11. **How to create a new directory?**  
    Use the command:  
    ```bash
    $ mkdir directory_name
    ```
    For help:
    ```bash
    $ man mkdir
    $ mkdir --help
    ```

12. **How to remove a directory?**  
    - To remove an **empty directory**:
      ```bash
      $ rmdir directory_name
      ```
      or
      ```bash
      $ rm -d directory_name
      ```
    - To remove a **non-empty directory**:
      ```bash
      $ rm -r directory_name
      ```
      `-r` stands for **recursive**, meaning it removes all subfolders and files.

    For help:
    ```bash
    $ man rmdir
    $ rmdir --help
    $ man rm
    ```
    ### 19. How can you copy a single line or multiple lines in `vi`/`vim`?

- **A.** For copying a single line we use → `yy` (yy stands for *Yankee*, meaning *copy*).
- **B.** For copying 2 lines we use → `2yy`.
- **C.** For copying 4 lines we use → `4yy`.
- **D.** Similarly, for copying *n* lines we use → `nyy`.

---

### 20. How can you paste a single line or multiple lines in `vi`/`vim`?

- **A.** For pasting a single line → use `p`.
- **B.** For pasting 2 lines → use `p` (press `p` again to paste multiple times).
- **C.** For pasting 4 lines → use `p` (repeat `p` or use a count before it, like `4p`).
- **D.** Similarly, for pasting *n* lines → use `p`.

> There are **two types** of pasting:
> - `P` → Paste **above** the current cursor line.
> - `p` → Paste **below** the current cursor line.

## 21. What is Linux? How many layers are present?

**Answer:**  
Linux is a free and open-source operating system (OS) kernel, which is the core component of a computer’s software stack.

It consists of two main layers:

1. **User Space** – Contains Applications.  
2. **Kernel Space** – Contains Device Drivers and Core Subsystems.

**Additional Notes:**

- Between user space and kernel space, there exist **320+ system calls** which allow communication between applications and the kernel.
- Peripheral access is possible only through **device drivers** present in the kernel space.
- A **driver** acts as a bridge between the operating system and hardware.
- **System call-backs** are used to facilitate communication from user space (applications) to kernel space (drivers).
- The kernel space includes five core subsystems:
  - **Process Management Subsystem**
  - **Memory Management Subsystem**
  - **File Management Subsystem**
  - **Device I/O Management Subsystem**
  - **Network Management Subsystem** (e.g., TCP/IP stack)
- Device Drivers are a part of the kernel space as well.

---

## 22. Can Applications Send Requests to Devices?

**Answer:**  
No, applications **cannot directly send requests** to devices.  
They must use **system calls**, which communicate the request to the device drivers in kernel space.

---

## 23. Who Can Initiate an I/O Request? (Application, Device Driver, Hardware)

**Answer:**  
- **Applications** can initiate an I/O request using system calls.
- **Device Drivers** cannot initiate the request by themselves.
- The **application starts** the interaction.

---

## 24. Can Devices Initiate an I/O Request Using Hardware Interrupt?

**Answer:**  
Yes, devices can initiate an I/O request using a **hardware interrupt** mechanism, which alerts the processor to handle data or a required task.

---

## 25. Are There Any Ways to Jump From Command Mode to Insert Mode in `vi`?

**Answer:**  
Yes, there are **three main ways**:

1. `i` – Inserts at the cursor position.
2. `O` – Opens a new line **above** the current line and enters insert mode.
3. `o` – Opens a new line **below** the current line and enters insert mode.

---

## 26. How to Jump to the Last Line or First Line in `vi`?

**Answer:**

- **Last Line:** Press `G` (uppercase).
- **First Line:** Press `gg`.
- **Specific Line Number:** Use either:
  - `:line_number<Enter>`
  - `line_numberG`

**Example:**  
To go to line 25 → `25G` or `:25<Enter>`

---

## 27. How Do You Exit From `man` Command Documentation?

**Answer:**  
Press **`q`** to quit the man page and return to the terminal prompt.

---

## 28. How Do You Delete Single/Multiple Lines in `vi`?

**Answer:**

- **Delete one line:** `dd`
- **Delete multiple lines:** `ndd`, where `n` is the number of lines

**Example:**  
Delete 4 lines → `4dd`

---

## 29. How Do You Search in `vi`?

**Answer:**

- To search: Use `/<string>` + `<Enter>`  
- This will move the cursor to the **first instance** of the string.

> **Note:** Searching is **case-sensitive** because C and `vi` treat uppercase and lowercase characters differently due to their distinct ASCII values.

---

## 30. How to Find the Next Instance of a Search String?

**Answer:**

- **Next instance (forward):** Press `n`
- **Previous instance (backward):** Press `N` or `Shift + n`
